##### 


##### Ensure the Zend Debugger is installed on your server.
The Zend Debugger comes bundled with Zend Server, Zend Core and Zend Platform, but can also be downloaded as a separate component from http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/downloads.
##### Ensure the machine on which your PDT is installed is an allowed host for your debugger. 
See Setting your PDT to be an Allowed Host for more information.
##### In PDT , configure your server according to the instructions under Adding Servers in the PHP Servers Preferences.
##### Ensure the correct settings are configured in your Debug Preferences and Installed Debuggers Preferences pages.
##### Ensure you have a dummy.php file in your remote server's document root.
