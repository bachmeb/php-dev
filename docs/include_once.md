##### What does the include_once() function do?
* *The include_once statement includes and evaluates the specified file during the execution of the script.*
* *This is a behavior similar to the include statement, with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already been included, it will not be included again, and include_once returns TRUE.*
* *As the name suggests, the file will be included just once.*
