##### What is a resource?
* *A resource is a special variable, holding a reference to an external resource.*
* *Resources are created and used by special functions.*
* *Resource variables hold special handlers to opened files, database connections, image canvas areas and the like*
* *Thanks to the reference-counting system introduced with PHP 4's Zend Engine, a resource with no more references to it is detected automatically, and it is freed by the garbage collector.*
* *For this reason, it is rarely necessary to free the memory manually.*
